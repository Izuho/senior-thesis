\par I am most grateful to my advisor Dr. Rudy Raymond for giving me the idea for this research. He not only gave me ideas, but also he gave me advice on all aspects of this research, including how to write a paper, contents of my presentation, comparisons with previous research, and how to conduct experiments. Without him, this research would not have been possible.

\par Besides my advisor, I would like to thank Prof. Hiroshi Imai. He gave me advice on how to make a presentation and discussion with me about the significance of this research. He encouraged me to do my first research and write my senior thesis.

\par Last but not the least, I thank all the members at Imai Laboratory. They asked good questions in my research presentations and reading-circle seminars, and their presentations were also a good stimulus for me. Especially Dr. Yuko Kuroki and Dr. Eyuri Wakakuwa encouraged me to do my research.
