\par In this chapter, we show the experiments of numerical simulation of image classification. This simulation is implemented with Python, and the main libraries used are NumPy \cite{harris2020array} for solving eigenvalue / eigenvector, Qiskit \cite{Qiskit} for quantum circuit simulator, PyTorch \cite{NEURIPS2019_9015} for parallelization. The experiments were conducted on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz 2.21GHz. The code used in this chapter is available from \cite{mycode}.
